We're starting out with a basic version of an application that uses hooks to manage state.

There are two things that we'd like you to make it

- **Context**: We want to manage state using React Context
- **Undo & Redo**: Adding undo / redo feature. After implementing context for state management we want to create a new reducer that manage the Undo / Redo Feature
## Introducting the Test

- Clone it
- Install it, it was built upon react-create-app 
- Add Context & Undo / Rdo & push it to your github profile
- Send the link back
- Take 2 days to finish it and submit it, even if the test is unfinished send it unfinished.
